# [Problem Solving] - Visual Studio Code를 통한 원격 빌드 통합 문제

## 2025-07-22

### [Problem Analysis] - 목표: VS Code 원격 빌드 실패 원인 분석

- **Project Path (Local & Remote):** `J:\Git_Fenok\hwar650v3kw_2nd_sw_branch3\HWAR650V3KW_BSW\Sourcecode`
- **Build System:** SCons (Python-based)
- **Compiler/Toolchain:** Tasking TriCore (`cctc.exe`, `ltc.exe`, `artc.exe`)
- **Remote Build Tool:** `paexec`
- **Remote Build Server IP:** `192.168.0.36`
- **Remote Server User Account:** `workuser` (Password: `gint1234`)
- **Existing Tasking Environment Build Command (Working):** `paexec \\192.168.0.36 -u workuser -p gint1234 -w ${CWD} "C:\Program Files\TASKING\TriCore v6.3r1\ctc\bin\amk" -j16 -j6`

### [Issue 1] - `paexec` 연결 오류 (`Err=0x4C3, 1219`)

- **Error Message:** `Failed to connect to \\192.168.0.36\\ADMIN$. 동일한 사용자가 둘 이상의 사용자 이름으로 서버 또는 공유 리소스에 다중 연결할 수 없습니다. ...`
- **Cause:** Windows network credential management policy. Conflict arises when attempting a new connection with different credentials to a server already connected with other credentials.
- **Impact:** Prevents `paexec` from connecting to the remote server, blocking any remote build operations.

### [Issue 2] - `ImportError: No module named scons_common` (Expected Next Problem)

- **Error Message:** `ImportError: No module named scons_common`
- **Cause:** Python environment on the remote server cannot find `scons_common` module when `SConstruct` is executed.
- **Possible Reasons:** `scons_common.py` file missing/corrupted on remote `J:` drive, or remote Python environment not recognizing the path correctly.

### [Proposed Solution & Next Steps]

- **3.1. `paexec` Connection Error Resolution (Most Critical):**
    - **Action:** User to execute `net use \\192.168.0.36 /delete` in an administrator PowerShell/CMD.
    - **Action:** User to restart VS Code completely.
    - **Action:** User to attempt build again and provide terminal output.
- **3.2. `ImportError: No module named scons_common` Resolution (After `paexec` fix):**
    - **Action:** User to verify `scons_common.py` existence and integrity on remote server at `J:\Git_Fenok\hwar650v3kw_2nd_sw_branch3\HWAR650V3KW_BSW\Sourcecode\site_scons\site_tools`.
    - **Action:** If file exists, investigate remote Python environment settings.
- **3.3. Visual Studio Code Configuration (`.vscode` files):**
    - **Note:** `c_cpp_properties.json`, `tasks.json`, `launch.json` files were provided previously for editing, building, and debugging. `tasks.json` JSON syntax error was resolved.
- **3.4. Eclipse Environment Emulation (Shortcuts, Code Colors):**
    - **Suggestion:** Install "Dark (Eclipse)" theme from VS Code Marketplace.
    - **Suggestion:** Map Eclipse shortcuts via `keybindings.json` (user to specify important shortcuts).
    - **Suggestion:** Use `clang-format` extension and `.clang-format` for code formatting.

### [User Request] - Next Action

- **Most Important:** User to execute `net use /delete` command and report results.
- **Action:** After `net use /delete`, attempt build in VS Code and provide terminal output.
